# Programming-Abstractions
This is from my Programming Abstractions class. (OCaml, Java, Python)

We learned about different programming paradigms, with a special focus on functional programming with functions such as Filter and Map, as they are also prevalent in other languages such as Java, Python, etc. For this reason, our first homework (HW1) was in OCaml, known for being a functional programming language. Our second and third homework assignments (HW2 and HW3) were in Java where we first learned about OOP and then focused on streams and in-built functional programming in Java. The last assignment (HW4) used Python where we also had a focus on the Python lambda functions (anonymous functions). By the end, we learned some features and foundations of different higher-level programming languages that will be useful for the future.
